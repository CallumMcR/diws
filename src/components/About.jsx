                  We are a small group of people who have a passion and love for food,
                  with my grandparents originally founding a little baking store with the name of Get Baking, I then
                  took it over and have recently decided to move to an online platform where I can spread the love of my
                  food, as well as allow everyone, and anyone to taste and experience
                  the delightful recipes my grandparents managed to develop, as well as share our families recipes that have
                  been exclusive to this family for generations!
